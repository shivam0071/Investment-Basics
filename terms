NAV - Net Assest Value
Just like we buy shares at a certain price based on the market
We buy Mutual Funds on NAV

Lets understand this with a simple example--

Suppose a fund has a total of 10k rupees to invest
it invests 8k in 2 stocks and keep 2k in cash (for the people who wants to exit a fund)

Suppose they buy
Stock - 800 Units with 8k
Liabilities - 2% per day...lets assume its 0 at the moment
Invested - 500 Rs

NAV =  Assets - Liabilities
       ____________________

       Total no of units(shares)


       8000 - 0
       _________ = 10
        800


So the NAV of this fund is 10
so if you invested 500 RS in this fund then you would have gotten 500 / 10 = (50 Units)

So after 1 year the..if the market was good and fund performed well
and NAV reached 15 then your profit would be

50 * 15 = 750 Rs

Profit = 750 - 500  = 250 rs
